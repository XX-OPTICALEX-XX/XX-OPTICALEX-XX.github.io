    <td>After Mr Keen showed us how to change our table from it only having table divisions to having a table header. After showing us how to also add our work from google sheets to our blog page. So I went and changed all my titles into table headers so they now have a yellow background and have blue text after my first 2 Pokemon games pokemon HeartGold and Pokemon SoulSilver (though I picked blue because I couldn't find a silver)  </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although I have got a lot done I have limited my learning by thinking there wasn’t anything else to do so I didn’t take my Ipad to make notes on, so after we were sent back and work on my blog I was stuck for what to do so I had to search up how to add a google sheet onto github. That would have been passable if it hadn’t confused me more so I ended up asking what to do.  </td>

    <td>Next time I can’t think that I’m done until I have thought of every possibility (in my ability) to improve my work so I can get the highest mark and show my effort reflects my grade.</td>
