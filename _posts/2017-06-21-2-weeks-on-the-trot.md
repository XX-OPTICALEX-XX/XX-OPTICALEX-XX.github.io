    <td>I went through my blogs to change the code to add colour to my titles but they came out as a terrible blend of blue and yellow which was actually horrible on a black background  </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning wasn't really hindered/limited by anything because even when we did the starter which was on repl.it. The starter involved creating some code so that anyone using it would only have to type their name and it becomes personalised to them I had one hitch but jboz-3141.github.io helped me out in under 10 seconds. Good news jboz is blogging as well so check him out it's a lot better than mine</td>
