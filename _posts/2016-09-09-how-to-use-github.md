    <td>I learnt how to successfully publish a basic document on github and as I am completely new to github I created an account like a total noob xx-opticalex-xx and an hour ago i started to learn the basics with what I had to do to be able to publish a static website but unlike a lot of other people I am not exactly the greatest person at computing but I don't really care because I enjoy it</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on my ability to put what I have wrote do and seen into practice, for example if a friend shows me how to start something and then guides me I can do but as soon as I am left alone I forget that all important step which means I am just like a fish out of water with no chance of getting onto the right path. But as soon as someone does that stop it is like the wall in front of me has been torn down and I can quickly proceed</td>

    <td>if stuck on that step make notes of what others have done and make a note of everything I have tried and only then may I go to someone for help or guidance where as if I just give up I wonâ€™t learn anything</td>
